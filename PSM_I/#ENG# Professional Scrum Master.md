# Professional Scrum Master I Exam Preparation Notes

## 1. Scrum Framework Overview

### 1.1 Scrum Definition

Scrum is a lightweight framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. It is based on **Empiricism** and **Lean Thinking**.

> "Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems."

### 1.2 Scrum Theoretical Foundations

| Theory            | Description                                                     | Importance                                |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Empiricism**    | Knowledge comes from experience, decisions based on observation | Grounds Scrum in reality, not assumptions |
| **Lean Thinking** | Minimize waste, focus on essentials                             | Optimizes value streams and efficiency    |

### 1.3 Three Pillars of Scrum

| Pillar           | Definition                                    | Importance             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Transparency** | Work and outcomes visible to all stakeholders | Enables inspection     |
| **Inspection**   | Regular examination of artifacts and progress | Facilitates adaptation |
| **Adaptation**   | Adjustments based on inspection results       | Makes Scrum effective  |

> **Key Point**: Pillars are interdependent. Without transparency, inspection is ineffective; without adaptation, inspection is meaningless.

## 2. Scrum Values (COFRC)

| Value          | Definition                                       | Importance                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Commitment** | Team commits to goals and supports each other    | Ensures collaboration          |
| **Focus**      | Team focuses on Sprint work                      | Maintains concentration        |
| **Openness**   | Open communication about work and challenges     | Promotes transparency          |
| **Respect**    | Mutual respect for competence and independence   | Builds trust                   |
| **Courage**    | Courage to do the right thing and solve problems | Enables continuous improvement |

> **Core Principle**: Scrum Values guide team behavior and enable the three pillars.

## 3. Scrum Roles

### 3.1 Scrum Team

*   **Size**: 5-9 members (ideal), max 10
*   **Structure**: No sub-teams or hierarchies
*   **Characteristics**:
    *   **Cross-functional**: Has all skills needed for value creation
    *   **Self-managing**: Decides internally who does what, when, and how

### 3.2 Role Responsibilities

| Role              | Responsibilities                                                                                                    | Key Points                                                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scrum Master**  | • Establish Scrum framework<br>• Facilitate self-management<br>• Remove impediments<br>• Ensure event effectiveness | • Servant-leader<br>• Not a project manager<br>• Serves team and organization       |
| **Product Owner** | • Maximize product value<br>• Manage Product Backlog<br>• Define Product Goal<br>• Engage stakeholders              | • Single role (not a committee)<br>• Decisions visible in Backlog and Increments    |
| **Developers**    | • Create Increments<br>• Plan Sprint work<br>• Follow DoD<br>• Adapt daily                                          | • 100% responsible for Sprint Goal<br>• No sub-teams<br>• Report to Scrum Master? ❌ |

> **Clarifications**:
>
> *   Scrum Master ≠ Project Manager
> *   Product Owner ≠ Product Manager
> *   Developers = All roles creating Increments

## 8. Common Misconceptions

## 10. Complete Scrum Framework

    Scrum Framework
    │
    ├─ Values (COFRC)
    ├─ Roles (SM/PO/Developers)
    ├─ Events (Sprint container)
    └─ Artifacts (with Commitments)
        └─ Definition of Done

> **Critical**: Scrum is non-negotiable. Partial implementation ≠ Scrum.
